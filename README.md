<h1> Password-Generator-Python </h1>

Here I have created a small program that can generate a password with a random string of text, numbers, and correct symbols which can be copied to the clipboard.

The main purpose of this project was to get to grips with PySimpleGUI and generating interfaces. I have experience with Shiny, but I wanted to try something a little
more flexible. You are also able to use the slider to choose the size of your password.

Here is the initial screen that you see:

After entering your details you will be presented with the password and additional options to copy to clipboard.

The main libraries used for this project were:

1. PySimpleGUI
2. pyperclip
3. random
